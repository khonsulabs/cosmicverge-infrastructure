<p>A note from <a href="https://github.com/ecton">Jon</a>, the primary creator of Cosmic Verge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cosmic Verge is my personal passion project. I quit my job in November 2019, and while I knew I wanted to develop an MMO, it took me until January of 2021 to come up with a vision of this project that matched my goals and desires in life.</p>
<p>Beyond wanting to have a small reliable income source, I love helping people. One of the reasons I play games is to unwind and relax, often with friends. I want this game to be a safe and healthy place for people to relax away from the stresses of life.</p>
<p>Another way I enjoy helping people is by helping to solve problems. By developing the game as an open-source project, I'm hoping that the project's code becomes useful beyond just the game itself.</p>
<p>Because I'm hoping to eventually make money off of this project, I want to ensure contributing to Cosmic Verge is rewarding for others. As such, my plans for recognizing contributions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All art and music will be credited and viewable on a searchable website (once discovered by players).</li>
<li>All code contributors will be credited in-game, on the website (eventually), and in this repository.</li>
<li>Exclusive in-game cosmetics will eventually be given to contributors.</li>
<li>Details need to be figured out on minimum qualifications, but regular contributors will have a free subscription to the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in contributing, don't hesitate to <a href="https://discord.khonsulabs.com/">hop on our Discord to chat with us</a>.</p>

behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.</p>
<h3 id="2-warning"><a class="header" href="#2-warning">2. Warning</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels

<h1 id="design-pillars"><a class="header" href="#design-pillars">Design Pillars</a></h1>
<h2 id="dont-be-greedy"><a class="header" href="#dont-be-greedy">Don't be greedy</a></h2>
<p>Too many games these days focus on how to increase Revenue Per User. The goal of this game's monetization is to have an optional, paid-subscription that is less than $5 USD per month and no other digital monetization. If there's enough interest in physical merchandise, that could be another avenue for making a sustainable business from this game.</p>
<p>The goal of the game's monetization are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Earn enough money to allow Jon to work on this full-time for the years to come</li>
<li>Ideally, earn enough money to have a small team (&lt; 10 people) work on this full-time for years to come</li>
</ol>
<p>We may try multiple strategies to monetize this game in a healthy way. If we can't make it succeed with a healthy business model, we will simply stop developing the game eventually rather than add immoral monetization practices.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-shouldnt-be-solvable"><a class="header" href="#the-game-shouldnt-be-solvable">The game shouldn't be &quot;solvable&quot;</a></h2>
<p>Game Wikis are a double-edged sword. They can help players get up to speed in a game quickly, but they can also cause players to be punished for being creative. For example, if you try to find a group for a raid in most popular MMOs, you might be subjected to a &quot;gear check&quot; to make sure you're running an optimal build. This is a terrible experience for someone who really enjoys a specific style of gameplay even though it might not be &quot;optimal.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="design-for-continuous-content"><a class="header" href="#design-for-continuous-content">Design for continuous content</a></h2>
<p>Each sytem of the game should be designed such that it can have &quot;secrets&quot; that can be discovered. These secrets could be new cosmetics, new materials, new recipes, bits of lore, or countless other options. Instead of releasing scheduled content updates, content will be continuously developed and added to the game.</p>
<p>The experience desired is that a pilot might be exploring a distant moon and discovered a wrecked ship that had gone unnoticed before. The pilot investigates the ship and discovers their assembler was configured with a recipe they hadn't seen before. They try it out and discover it's a more efficient way of creating armor plating.</p>
<p>The pilot will then have a choice: publish it to the &quot;public library&quot; and be recognized as the player who discovered it, or try to make money off of it by either selling the knowledge or using it to try to cut out competition on the market.</p>
<p>This type of design will go a long way in keeping the game feeling fresh, and as long as we design these systems with this idea in mind, hopefully players will be happy with the amount of content a small team can produce.</p>
<h2 id="each-game-system-should-be-engaging-for-an-audience"><a class="header" href="#each-game-system-should-be-engaging-for-an-audience">Each game system should be engaging for an audience</a></h2>
<p>In many sandbox games, some systems are clearly not the first priority of the developers. Each game system in Cosmic Verge should be designed with the idea that someone might dedicate all of their time playing the game in that one activity. If this feels like overkill for any given system, we should ask the question, do we really need that system?</p>
<h2 id="encourage-cooperative-play-while-still-allowing-for-solo-enjoyment"><a class="header" href="#encourage-cooperative-play-while-still-allowing-for-solo-enjoyment">Encourage cooperative play, while still allowing for solo enjoyment</a></h2>
<p>Players should be encouraged to join others and work together. The game should make it easy to be social with methods to find other players and groups. But while there may be specific multiplayer-only experiences, the game should be perfectly enjoyable solo.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The game is seeded with a single space station. A democratic voting system enables all pilots and citizens (NPC populations) to vote on community objectives. Pilots would have missions to gather resources, move large amounts of resources and parts around, manufacture parts, and more that would all contribute towards completing the objectives, allowing for future votes to unlock additional opportunities expansion.</p>
<p>The objectives would shape the universe itself. Upgrade existing space station, build new ones, build new stargates to establish links to new civilizations, and special new objectives developed and added to the pool regularly.</p>
<p>The universe will become what the community decides it will.</p>

<h2 id="definitions"><a class="header" href="#definitions">Definitions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pilot</strong>: An individual character for a player.</li>
<li><strong>Population</strong>: A group of simulated non-playable characters.</li>
<li><strong>Space Station</strong>: A structure that is capable of housing populations and various modules.</li>
<li><strong>Modules</strong>: Craftable items that can be installed in various structures including space stations and player ships. Modules will have different sizes and requirements, limiting some to only larger structures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="navigational-capabilities"><a class="header" href="#navigational-capabilities">Navigational capabilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stargate</strong>: Ability for all ships up to a given size to travel between two connected stargates or hyperspace lanes or similar technology. While this document uses the term stargate, the actual technology is not being decided at this moment.</li>
<li><strong>Jump Drive</strong>: Ability for select ships to travel between nearby stars without needing a stargate.</li>
<li><strong>Impulse Navigation</strong>: Within a star system, a ship will be able to accelerate based on its thrust and total mass indefinitely to build up as much speed as it can before turning around and using the same thrust to decelerate it to arrive at its destination.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overall-theme"><a class="header" href="#overall-theme">Overall Theme</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A hint of realism.</p>
<p>While it's ok to waive away aspects of realism to make a game enjoyable, we should try to take inspiration from real theoretical science when we can.</p>
<p>An example in the above section is impulse navigation: this is how physics works as we know it with Newton's laws of motion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plenty of fun.</p>
<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a universe full of fun. The original Star Trek was fairly campy, but it is still beloved and sparked interest in space exploration. Each generation since has done similar while still throwing scientific realism out the window habitually. We should not fear to be unique and interesting and funny even though we want a universe with some grounding in reality.</p>
<p>An example of this is also impulse navigation: the current simplification ignores planetary gravity and waves away the idea of how much fuel would be necessary to perform those maneuvers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="simulated-npc-populations"><a class="header" href="#simulated-npc-populations">Simulated NPC Populations</a></h1>
<p>The universe would have various colonized worlds that contain NPC populations, and each space station will have the ability to have housing facility modules installed. Each location that has populations will attract a diverse population of NPCs based on what the station has available, pricing, and what's nearby. These populations are a source of competition for pilots, as they influnce the world in significant ways.</p>
<p>For populations to live, they need basic supplies. If a location doesn't supply its population with enough supplies to keep them happy, some may move to other locations.</p>
<p>Populations also will travel for business and for pleasure, enabling a vibrant tourism industry.</p>
<p>There are multiple ideas for reasons a location would want to encourage a large population to move in, travel through, or visit:</p>
<h2 id="player-stores"><a class="header" href="#player-stores">Player Stores</a></h2>
<p>Imagine running simulation games similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand">Lemonade Stand</a> or modern takes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook,_Serve,_Delicious!">Cook. Serve. Delicious!</a>, but instead of a solo game you're competing against supplying meals to the population living in the location you rented shop space in.</p>
<p>If the core design is done well, the same concept can be expanded on by adding more variations to business types by reusing core logic with new twists. Examples could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clubs: Allow DJs to organize shared listening experiences for patrons -- both NPCs and pilots. Composers/Musicians could upload content licensed appropriately and have their tracks available for DJs to organize into playlists that are heard simultaneously to those who are in the same location. Those artists would have their name, track name, and a profile allowing fans to find them outside of the game.</li>
<li>Movie Theaters: Allow shared video watching (Synced YouTube? Odysee? Partnered content producers that upload with CC license?) This idea is less thought out than the club idea, but <a href="https://lbry.com/">LBRY</a> inspired this thought recently.</li>
<li>Game Halls: Implement a simple way for game designers to create card and board games that are playable inside of the universe. Developers could have fun writing AI implementations for games and seeing their AIs compete as NPC populations visit the game halls. And, pilots could compete with a shared leaderboard and tournament system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="voting"><a class="header" href="#voting">Voting</a></h2>
<p>Players that help operate the station or its stores will be able to endorse community objectives, and if populations are happy with their experience in the station or store, they might be influenced by your endorsement. By building a big population and keeping them happy, you strengthen your ability to influence the way the universe unfolds.</p>
<h1 id="elections"><a class="header" href="#elections">Elections</a></h1>
<p>Elections will be an opportunity to shape the course of Cosmic Verge. Elections will be held on a regular basis, and will support a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting">ranked-choice voting</a>, with a goal of helping educate more people on the benefits of such a system.</p>
<h2 id="community-objectives"><a class="header" href="#community-objectives">Community Objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upgrade a space station</p>
<p>Community-owned space stations can be expanded, but the requirements for expanding get higher as the station gets larger. Expanding a space station adds more capacity for modules.</p>
<p>In addition to expanding a station, modules can be installed into stations. These modules can include retail space for shops, manufacturing facilities, population housing, and more.</p>
<p>All major operations made to community-owned station would be done this way, including replacing existing modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a new space station</p>
<p>Instead of adding to an existing station, maybe it's time to put a new station near a newly discovered tourist attraction and try to get some of that lucrative space cash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build a stargate</p>
<p>Connect two stars within certain limits together. If the target system is not currently on the stargate network, this objective would require deep-space transport of construction materials to the target system which is no easy task. But, once the systems are connected, it may lead to more reliable trade for perishable goods or more trade between newly discovered civilizations.</p>
<p>Each star system would only support a specific number of star gates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-route a stargate</p>
<p>Don't like how the stargates are connected? Re-route the universe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="game-development"><a class="header" href="#game-development">Game Development</a></h2>
<p>All pilots should be able to provide feedback on a regular basis as well as vote on decisions for future development of the sandbox. While there is a role for the game designer to ensure no one system being added to the sandbox will break it or be a bad experience, ultimately this concept is inspired by the idea of letting the community expand the universe, so it seems natural to offer some ability for players to influence the development roadmap.</p>
<h2 id="station-management"><a class="header" href="#station-management">Station Management</a></h2>
<p>While major decisions in community-owned stations are made by the community, day-to-day decisions need a team to run them. These positions would be elected by the community, and would be able to make decisions that could influence additional tourism or affect the happiness of the population living there.</p>
<h1 id="everything-is-buildable"><a class="header" href="#everything-is-buildable">Everything is Buildable</a></h1>
<p>Up until this point, all stations have been called &quot;community-owned&quot;. There's a reason for the distiction: While it requires a lot of resources and a lot of manpower, you could build your own space station. Upkeep isn't cheap either, but to aide you can collect the taxes that normally the government collects.</p>
<p>Or, maybe you want to install a new trade route but tax ships that travel through it? Build your own stargates!</p>
<h2 id="materials"><a class="header" href="#materials">Materials</a></h2>
<p>Materials should come from many sources, but some examples could include mining asteroids, importing exports from planets (a primary source of food ingredients), and exploration discovering abandoned ships/wrecks/archaelogical sites and yielding rare materials.</p>
<p>Materials have a &quot;quality&quot; attribute that determines how pure the material is. Various factors can impact the quality of the materials. Let's think of a vegetable being exported from a planet. When you go to the supermarket, some produce is clearly superior to other produce. The quality of materials should be affected by the process in which the materials were collected.</p>
<p>Materials can also be perishable. Those items either need to be preserved to keep from going bad or used before it goes bad. Delivering perishable delicacies to distant locations before they expire could be a lucrative career. The downside to preserving materials is that it lowers the quality.</p>
<h2 id="crafting"><a class="header" href="#crafting">Crafting</a></h2>
<p>Crafting shouldn't just be done by looking up a recipe online. Inevitably, recipes will be published and many people will just use existing recipes. However, the design of the recipe system should be such that there are many solutions of &quot;how to build X&quot; involving different processes, different amounts of materials, different require material qualities, etc.</p>
<p>A viable profession in the game should be inventing recipes: trying to find new ways to build items. Recipe invention involves writing, testing, and tweaking recipes and the sample products produced. At the core, each &quot;step&quot; in a recipe will take one or more inputs, perform an operation (a function available from a module installed in the machine), and produce one or more outputs that can then be used in future steps.</p>
<p>For players more interested in becoming a manufacturer, they can purchase recipes from other players and install the recipe's required modules in their assembly machines (on their own ship or in rented facilities on a station). The player will either need to manually load the machines with the required materials and transfer intermediate results as needed (for a one-off job), or set up conveyor belts and automation machines for a constant production pipeline.</p>
<h1 id="social-is-king"><a class="header" href="#social-is-king">Social is King</a></h1>
<p>Corporations/Guilds are a necessity, as are hierarchical structures such as alliances and coalitions. While the community should be able to regularly expand the universe, alliances should be able to build their own station, and coalitions should be able to build their own trade routes. This isn't to say that a corporation couldn't establish its own trade routes, just that the task of building stargates will require one of the largest resource investments in the game, so the task is likely be taken on by a coalition of alliances.</p>
<h1 id="exploration"><a class="header" href="#exploration">Exploration</a></h1>
<p>The galaxy is a big place with countless stars and planets. An explorer will want a ship that has its own jump drive, as they will want to go beyond the established travel routes. There will be large amounts of space for us to create events and sites for players to discover.</p>
<h1 id="initial-gameplay-thoughts"><a class="header" href="#initial-gameplay-thoughts">Initial Gameplay Thoughts</a></h1>
<p>This game is being designed as a 2d game. The primary mode of movement will be moving a character around in a fashion similar to classic RPGs. When you board a ship, you will physically walk around on the ship. Sitting in the captains chair will open the piloting interface.</p>
<p>While this game is game set in space, at its core it's a 2D sandbox MMORPG.</p>
<h2 id="piloting-your-ship"><a class="header" href="#piloting-your-ship">Piloting your ship</a></h2>
<p>In the piloting interface, you see the exterior of the ship and be able to navigate to nearby celestial objects or plot a course to a remote star. Once your ship is in motion, you can step out of the captains chair and enjoy the amenities of your ship.</p>
<h2 id="other-ship-roles"><a class="header" href="#other-ship-roles">Other ship roles</a></h2>
<p>While the player's starting ship will only have one role to be fulfilled (captain), other ships may require additional crew. You can hire NPCs to be part of your crew, or if you've found a group of friends to fly with, you can take to the stars as a fleet or together on a single vessel.</p>
<h1 id="galaxy"><a class="header" href="#galaxy">Galaxy</a></h1>
<p>The galaxy will be modeled after a SBd type galaxy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification#/media/File:Hubble_-_de_Vaucouleurs_Galaxy_Morphology_Diagram.png">from this diagram</a>. The populated universe will reside in a section of the galaxy that is cut off from the main body of the galaxy. This leaves a large portion of the galaxy undiscovered and unexplored, and could offer future expansion possibilities or wormhole-based randomized exploration.</p>
