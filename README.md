# Cosmic Verge "Nursery"

This repository contains the [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) source behind [docs.cosmicverge.com/nursery](https://docs.cosmicverge.com/nursery/).

This document is separate from the [code repository](https://github.com/khonsulabs/cosmicverge) for multiple reasons:

- This document guides all aspects of Cosmic Verge, not just code. It is meant to be a unifying document that ties all contributors together: developers, designers, composers, writers, and more.
- The game-design portions of this document initially are going to be designed primarily by [@ecton](https://github.com/ecton) and aren't going to go through the same code review processes.
- Changes to this document don't directly impact anything within the codebase.

## Goals of this repository

This repository should act as a guide for the development of Cosmic Verge. This includes:

- How to contribute
- What's expected of contributors and their contributions
- The design of the game and its systems
- The lore of the universe

The nickname "nursery" is a reference to [stellar nurseries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation).
