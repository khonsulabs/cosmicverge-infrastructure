# Welcome

A note from [Jon](https://github.com/ecton), the primary creator of Cosmic Verge:

> Cosmic Verge is my personal passion project. I quit my job in November 2019, and while I knew I wanted to develop an MMO, it took me until January of 2021 to come up with a vision of this project that matched my goals and desires in life.
>
> Beyond wanting to have a small reliable income source, I love helping people. One of the reasons I play games is to unwind and relax, often with friends. I want this game to be a safe and healthy place for people to relax away from the stresses of life.
>
> Another way I enjoy helping people is by helping to solve problems. By developing the game as an open-source project, I'm hoping that the project's code becomes useful beyond just the game itself.
>
> Because I'm hoping to eventually make money off of this project, I want to ensure contributing to Cosmic Verge is rewarding for others. As such, my plans for recognizing contributions include:
>
> - All art and music will be credited and viewable on a searchable website (once discovered by players).
> - All code contributors will be credited in-game, on the website (eventually), and in this repository.
> - Exclusive in-game cosmetics will eventually be given to contributors.
> - Details need to be figured out on minimum qualifications, but regular contributors will have a free subscription to the game.
>
> If you are interested in contributing, don't hesitate to [hop on our Discord to chat with us](https://discord.khonsulabs.com/).

## About the Nursery

The word Nursery is a reference to [stellar nurseries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation). Instead of stars being formed, Cosmic Verge is what is being made from this nursery.

This document is meant to be a living document to guide development of Cosmic Verge. It is an amalgamation of our community guidelines, contribution standards, and game design document.
