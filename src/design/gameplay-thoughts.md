# Initial Gameplay Thoughts

This game is being designed as a 2d game. The primary mode of movement will be moving a character around in a fashion similar to classic RPGs. When you board a ship, you will physically walk around on the ship. Sitting in the captains chair will open the piloting interface.

While this game is game set in space, at its core it's a 2D sandbox MMORPG.

## Piloting your ship

In the piloting interface, you see the exterior of the ship and be able to navigate to nearby celestial objects or plot a course to a remote star. Once your ship is in motion, you can step out of the captains chair and enjoy the amenities of your ship.

## Other ship roles

While the player's starting ship will only have one role to be fulfilled (captain), other ships may require additional crew. You can hire NPCs to be part of your crew, or if you've found a group of friends to fly with, you can take to the stars as a fleet or together on a single vessel.
