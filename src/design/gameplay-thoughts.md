# Initial Gameplay Thoughts

> These ideas are not set in stone. They are written down as a brainstorming experiment. If any thing in particular speaks to you, please let [us know on Discord](https://discord.khonsulabs.com).

## The Community Sandbox

The game is seeded with a single space station. A democratic voting system enables all pilots and citizens (NPC populations) to vote on community objectives. Pilots would have missions to gather resources, move large amounts of resources and parts around, manufacture parts, and more that would all contribute towards completing the objectives, allowing for future votes to unlock additional opportunities expansion.

The objectives would shape the universe itself. Upgrade existing space station, build new ones, build new stargates to establish links to new civilizations, and special new objectives developed and added to the pool regularly.

The universe will become what the community decides it will.

## Ideas for the sandbox

### Fundamentals

#### Definitions

- **Pilot**: An individual character for a player.
- **Population**: A group of simulated non-playable characters.
- **Space Station**: A structure that is capable of housing populations and various modules.
- **Modules**: Craftable items that can be installed in various structures including space stations and player ships. Modules will have different sizes and requirements, limiting some to only larger structures.

#### Navigational capabilities

- **Stargate**: Ability for all ships up to a given size to travel between two connected stargates or hyperspace lanes or similar technology. While this document uses the term stargate, the actual technology is not being decided at this moment.
- **Jump Drive**: Ability for select ships to travel between nearby stars without needing a stargate.
- **Impulse Navigation**: Within a star system, a ship will be able to accelerate based on its thrust and total mass indefinitely to build up as much speed as it can before turning around and using the same thrust to decelerate it to arrive at its destination.

#### Overall Theme

- A hint of realism.

  While it's ok to waive away aspects of realism to make a game enjoyable, we should try to take inspiration from real theoretical science when we can.

  An example in the above section is impulse navigation: this is how physics works as we know it with Newton's laws of motion

- Plenty of fun.

  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a universe full of fun. The original Star Trek was fairly campy, but it is still beloved and sparked interest in space exploration. Each generation since has done similar while still throwing scientific realism out the window habitually. We should not fear to be unique and interesting and funny even though we want a universe with some grounding in reality.

  An example of this is also impulse navigation: the current simplification ignores planetary gravity and waves away the idea of how much fuel would be necessary to perform those maneuvers.

### Simulated NPC Populations

The universe would have various colonized worlds that contain NPC populations, and each space station will have the ability to have housing facility modules installed. Each location that has populations will attract a diverse population of NPCs based on what the station has available, pricing, and what's nearby. These populations are a source of competition for pilots, as they influnce the world in significant ways.

For populations to live, they need basic supplies. If a location doesn't supply its population with enough supplies to keep them happy, some may move to other locations.

Populations also will travel for business and for pleasure, enabling a vibrant tourism industry.

There are multiple ideas for reasons a location would want to encourage a large population to move in, travel through, or visit:

- Player Stores

  Imagine running simulation games similar to [Lemonade Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand) or modern takes like [Cook. Serve. Delicious!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook,_Serve,_Delicious!), but instead of a solo game you're competing against supplying meals to the population living in the location you rented shop space in.

  If the core design is done well, the same concept can be expanded on by adding more variations to business types by reusing core logic with new twists. Examples could include:

  - Clubs: Allow DJs to organize shared listening experiences for patrons -- both NPCs and pilots. Composers/Musicians could upload content licensed appropriately and have their tracks available for DJs to organize into playlists that are heard simultaneously to those who are in the same location. Those artists would have their name, track name, and a profile allowing fans to find them outside of the game.
  - Movie Theaters: Allow shared video watching (Synced YouTube? Odysee? Partnered content producers that upload with CC license?) This idea is less thought out than the club idea, but [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) inspired this thought recently.
  - Game Halls: Implement a simple way for game designers to create card and board games that are playable inside of the universe. Developers could have fun writing AI implementations for games and seeing their AIs compete as NPC populations visit the game halls. And, pilots could compete with a shared leaderboard and tournament system.

- Voting

  Players that help operate the station or its stores will be able to endorse community objectives, and if populations are happy with their experience in the station or store, they might be influenced by your endorsement. By building a big population and keeping them happy, you strengthen your ability to influence the way the universe unfolds.

### Elections

Elections will be an opportunity to shape the course of Cosmic Verge. Elections will be held on a regular basis, and will support a form of [ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting), with a goal of helping educate more people on the benefits of such a system.

#### Community Objectives

- Upgrade a space station

  Community-owned space stations can be expanded, but the requirements for expanding get higher as the station gets larger. Expanding a space station adds more capacity for modules.

  In addition to expanding a station, modules can be installed into stations. These modules can include retail space for shops, manufacturing facilities, population housing, and more.

  All major operations made to community-owned station would be done this way, including replacing existing modules.

- Build a new space station

  Instead of adding to an existing station, maybe it's time to put a new station near a newly discovered tourist attraction and try to get some of that lucrative space cash.

- Build a stargate

  Connect two stars within certain limits together. If the target system is not currently on the stargate network, this objective would require deep-space transport of construction materials to the target system which is no easy task. But, once the systems are connected, it may lead to more reliable trade for perishable goods or more trade between newly discovered civilizations.

  Each star system would only support a specific number of star gates.

- Re-route a stargate

  Don't like how the stargates are connected? Re-route the universe.

#### Game Development

All pilots should be able to provide feedback on a regular basis as well as vote on decisions for future development of the sandbox. While there is a role for the game designer to ensure no one system being added to the sandbox will break it or be a bad experience, ultimately this concept is inspired by the idea of letting the community expand the universe, so it seems natural to offer some ability for players to influence the development roadmap.

#### Station Management

While major decisions in community-owned stations are made by the community, day-to-day decisions need a team to run them. These positions would be elected by the community, and would be able to make decisions that could influence additional tourism or affect the happiness of the population living there.

### Everything is Buildable

Up until this point, all stations have been called "community-owned". There's a reason for the distiction: While it requires a lot of resources and a lot of manpower, you could build your own space station. Upkeep isn't cheap either, but to aide you can collect the taxes that normally the government collects.

Or, maybe you want to install a new trade route but tax ships that travel through it? Build your own stargates!

### Social is King

Corporations/Guilds are a necessity, as are hierarchical structures such as alliances and coalitions. While the community should be able to regularly expand the universe, alliances should be able to build their own station, and coalitions should be able to build their own trade routes. This isn't to say that a corporation couldn't establish its own trade routes, just that the task of building stargates will require one of the largest resource investments in the game, so the task is likely be taken on by a coalition of alliances.
