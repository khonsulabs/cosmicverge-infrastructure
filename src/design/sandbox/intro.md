# Introduction

The game is seeded with a single space station. A democratic voting system enables all pilots and citizens (NPC populations) to vote on community objectives. Pilots would have missions to gather resources, move large amounts of resources and parts around, manufacture parts, and more that would all contribute towards completing the objectives, allowing for future votes to unlock additional opportunities expansion.

The objectives would shape the universe itself. Upgrade existing space station, build new ones, build new stargates to establish links to new civilizations, and special new objectives developed and added to the pool regularly.

The universe will become what the community decides it will.
