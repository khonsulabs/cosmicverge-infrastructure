# Elections

Elections will be an opportunity to shape the course of Cosmic Verge. Elections will be held on a regular basis, and will support a form of [ranked-choice voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting), with a goal of helping educate more people on the benefits of such a system.

## Community Objectives

- Upgrade a space station

  Community-owned space stations can be expanded, but the requirements for expanding get higher as the station gets larger. Expanding a space station adds more capacity for modules.

  In addition to expanding a station, modules can be installed into stations. These modules can include retail space for shops, manufacturing facilities, population housing, and more.

  All major operations made to community-owned station would be done this way, including replacing existing modules.

- Build a new space station

  Instead of adding to an existing station, maybe it's time to put a new station near a newly discovered tourist attraction and try to get some of that lucrative space cash.

- Build a stargate

  Connect two stars within certain limits together. If the target system is not currently on the stargate network, this objective would require deep-space transport of construction materials to the target system which is no easy task. But, once the systems are connected, it may lead to more reliable trade for perishable goods or more trade between newly discovered civilizations.

  Each star system would only support a specific number of star gates.

- Re-route a stargate

  Don't like how the stargates are connected? Re-route the universe.

## Game Development

All pilots should be able to provide feedback on a regular basis as well as vote on decisions for future development of the sandbox. While there is a role for the game designer to ensure no one system being added to the sandbox will break it or be a bad experience, ultimately this concept is inspired by the idea of letting the community expand the universe, so it seems natural to offer some ability for players to influence the development roadmap.

## Station Management

While major decisions in community-owned stations are made by the community, day-to-day decisions need a team to run them. These positions would be elected by the community, and would be able to make decisions that could influence additional tourism or affect the happiness of the population living there.
