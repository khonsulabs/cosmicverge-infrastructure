# Simulated NPC Populations

The universe would have various colonized worlds that contain NPC populations, and each space station will have the ability to have housing facility modules installed. Each location that has populations will attract a diverse population of NPCs based on what the station has available, pricing, and what's nearby. These populations are a source of competition for pilots, as they influnce the world in significant ways.

For populations to live, they need basic supplies. If a location doesn't supply its population with enough supplies to keep them happy, some may move to other locations.

Populations also will travel for business and for pleasure, enabling a vibrant tourism industry.

There are multiple ideas for reasons a location would want to encourage a large population to move in, travel through, or visit:

## Player Stores

Imagine running simulation games similar to [Lemonade Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemonade_Stand) or modern takes like [Cook. Serve. Delicious!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook,_Serve,_Delicious!), but instead of a solo game you're competing against supplying meals to the population living in the location you rented shop space in.

If the core design is done well, the same concept can be expanded on by adding more variations to business types by reusing core logic with new twists. Examples could include:

- Clubs: Allow DJs to organize shared listening experiences for patrons -- both NPCs and pilots. Composers/Musicians could upload content licensed appropriately and have their tracks available for DJs to organize into playlists that are heard simultaneously to those who are in the same location. Those artists would have their name, track name, and a profile allowing fans to find them outside of the game.
- Movie Theaters: Allow shared video watching (Synced YouTube? Odysee? Partnered content producers that upload with CC license?) This idea is less thought out than the club idea, but [LBRY](https://lbry.com/) inspired this thought recently.
- Game Halls: Implement a simple way for game designers to create card and board games that are playable inside of the universe. Developers could have fun writing AI implementations for games and seeing their AIs compete as NPC populations visit the game halls. And, pilots could compete with a shared leaderboard and tournament system.

## Voting

Players that help operate the station or its stores will be able to endorse community objectives, and if populations are happy with their experience in the station or store, they might be influenced by your endorsement. By building a big population and keeping them happy, you strengthen your ability to influence the way the universe unfolds.
