# Everything is Buildable

Up until this point, all stations have been called "community-owned". There's a reason for the distiction: While it requires a lot of resources and a lot of manpower, you could build your own space station. Upkeep isn't cheap either, but to aide you can collect the taxes that normally the government collects.

Or, maybe you want to install a new trade route but tax ships that travel through it? Build your own stargates!

## Materials

Materials should come from many sources, but some examples could include mining asteroids, importing exports from planets (a primary source of food ingredients), and exploration discovering abandoned ships/wrecks/archaelogical sites and yielding rare materials.

Materials have a "quality" attribute that determines how pure the material is. Various factors can impact the quality of the materials. Let's think of a vegetable being exported from a planet. When you go to the supermarket, some produce is clearly superior to other produce. The quality of materials should be affected by the process in which the materials were collected.

Materials can also be perishable. Those items either need to be preserved to keep from going bad or used before it goes bad. Delivering perishable delicacies to distant locations before they expire could be a lucrative career. The downside to preserving materials is that it lowers the quality.

## Crafting

Crafting shouldn't just be done by looking up a recipe online. Inevitably, recipes will be published and many people will just use existing recipes. However, the design of the recipe system should be such that there are many solutions of "how to build X" involving different processes, different amounts of materials, different require material qualities, etc.

A viable profession in the game should be inventing recipes: trying to find new ways to build items. Recipe invention involves writing, testing, and tweaking recipes and the sample products produced. At the core, each "step" in a recipe will take one or more inputs, perform an operation (a function available from a module installed in the machine), and produce one or more outputs that can then be used in future steps.

For players more interested in becoming a manufacturer, they can purchase recipes from other players and install the recipe's required modules in their assembly machines (on their own ship or in rented facilities on a station). The player will either need to manually load the machines with the required materials and transfer intermediate results as needed (for a one-off job), or set up conveyor belts and automation machines for a constant production pipeline.
