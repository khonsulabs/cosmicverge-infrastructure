# Social is King

Corporations/Guilds are a necessity, as are hierarchical structures such as alliances and coalitions. While the community should be able to regularly expand the universe, alliances should be able to build their own station, and coalitions should be able to build their own trade routes. This isn't to say that a corporation couldn't establish its own trade routes, just that the task of building stargates will require one of the largest resource investments in the game, so the task is likely be taken on by a coalition of alliances.
