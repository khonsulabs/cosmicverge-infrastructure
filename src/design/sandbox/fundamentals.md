# Sandbox Fundamentals

## Definitions

- **Pilot**: An individual character for a player.
- **Population**: A group of simulated non-playable characters.
- **Space Station**: A structure that is capable of housing populations and various modules.
- **Modules**: Craftable items that can be installed in various structures including space stations and player ships. Modules will have different sizes and requirements, limiting some to only larger structures.

## Navigational capabilities

- **Stargate**: Ability for all ships up to a given size to travel between two connected stargates or hyperspace lanes or similar technology. While this document uses the term stargate, the actual technology is not being decided at this moment.
- **Jump Drive**: Ability for select ships to travel between nearby stars without needing a stargate.
- **Impulse Navigation**: Within a star system, a ship will be able to accelerate based on its thrust and total mass indefinitely to build up as much speed as it can before turning around and using the same thrust to decelerate it to arrive at its destination.

## Overall Theme

- A hint of realism.

  While it's ok to waive away aspects of realism to make a game enjoyable, we should try to take inspiration from real theoretical science when we can.

  An example in the above section is impulse navigation: this is how physics works as we know it with Newton's laws of motion

- Plenty of fun.

  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a universe full of fun. The original Star Trek was fairly campy, but it is still beloved and sparked interest in space exploration. Each generation since has done similar while still throwing scientific realism out the window habitually. We should not fear to be unique and interesting and funny even though we want a universe with some grounding in reality.

  An example of this is also impulse navigation: the current simplification ignores planetary gravity and waves away the idea of how much fuel would be necessary to perform those maneuvers.
