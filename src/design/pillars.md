# Design Pillars

## Don't be greedy

Too many games these days focus on how to increase Revenue Per User. The goal of this game's monetization is to have an optional, paid-subscription that is less than $5 USD per month and no other digital monetization. If there's enough interest in physical merchandise, that could be another avenue for making a sustainable business from this game.

The goal of the game's monetization are simple:

1. Earn enough money to allow Jon to work on this full-time for the years to come
2. Ideally, earn enough money to have a small team (< 10 people) work on this full-time for years to come

We may try multiple strategies to monetize this game in a healthy way. If we can't make it succeed with a healthy business model, we will simply stop developing the game eventually rather than add immoral monetization practices.

## The game shouldn't be "solvable"

Game Wikis are a double-edged sword. They can help players get up to speed in a game quickly, but they can also cause players to be punished for being creative. For example, if you try to find a group for a raid in most popular MMOs, you might be subjected to a "gear check" to make sure you're running an optimal build. This is a terrible experience for someone who really enjoys a specific style of gameplay even though it might not be "optimal."

## Design for continuous content

Each sytem of the game should be designed such that it can have "secrets" that can be discovered. These secrets could be new cosmetics, new materials, new recipes, bits of lore, or countless other options. Instead of releasing scheduled content updates, content will be continuously developed and added to the game.

The experience desired is that a pilot might be exploring a distant moon and discovered a wrecked ship that had gone unnoticed before. The pilot investigates the ship and discovers their assembler was configured with a recipe they hadn't seen before. They try it out and discover it's a more efficient way of creating armor plating.

The pilot will then have a choice: publish it to the "public library" and be recognized as the player who discovered it, or try to make money off of it by either selling the knowledge or using it to try to cut out competition on the market.

This type of design will go a long way in keeping the game feeling fresh, and as long as we design these systems with this idea in mind, hopefully players will be happy with the amount of content a small team can produce.

## Each game system should be engaging for an audience

In many sandbox games, some systems are clearly not the first priority of the developers. Each game system in Cosmic Verge should be designed with the idea that someone might dedicate all of their time playing the game in that one activity. If this feels like overkill for any given system, we should ask the question, do we really need that system?

## Encourage cooperative play, while still allowing for solo enjoyment

Players should be encouraged to join others and work together. The game should make it easy to be social with methods to find other players and groups. But while there may be specific multiplayer-only experiences, the game should be perfectly enjoyable solo.
