# Galaxy

The galaxy will be modeled after a SBd type galaxy [from this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification#/media/File:Hubble_-_de_Vaucouleurs_Galaxy_Morphology_Diagram.png). The populated universe will reside in a section of the galaxy that is cut off from the main body of the galaxy. This leaves a large portion of the galaxy undiscovered and unexplored, and could offer future expansion possibilities or wormhole-based randomized exploration.
